**Summary:**
This project, completed as part of a BS in Computer Science Semester 5 course, involved analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to understand its global impact. The datasets used, including the number of recovery cases, death cases, and confirmed cases, were sourced from Johns Hopkins University. The analysis encompassed various aspects, including cleaning the data, calculating total cases worldwide, identifying the top countries affected, and predicting future trends using linear regression models.

**Key Findings:**
- The project began with data cleaning, renaming columns, and aggregating the data to calculate total confirmed, recovered, death, and active cases worldwide.
- Visualization played a crucial role in understanding the data trends. Plots and maps were used to visualize the increase in cases over time, the distribution of cases across countries, and the impact of COVID-19 on different regions.
- The top countries with the highest number of confirmed, death, recovery, and active cases were identified and visualized, providing insights into the countries most affected by the pandemic.
- Further analysis focused on the impact of COVID-19 on wealthy countries, such as Luxembourg, Singapore, Qatar, Ireland, and Switzerland. The trends in these countries were compared and visualized to understand their respective situations.
- Finally, polynomial linear regression models were employed to predict future trends in confirmed, death, recovery, and active cases worldwide based on the dataset. While these models provided insights into potential future trends, it's important to consider various factors that could influence the actual outcomes, such as vaccination rates and government interventions.

**Achievement:**
This project received an O grade, scoring 40 out of 50 points, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques. It showcased the ability to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets effectively, providing valuable insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
