# Covid19-Worldwide_Impact_DataAnalysis_Visualization_Prediction
Created this for my third year (Semester 5) project on October 2021. Collected three datasets (no. of recovery cases, no. of death cases, no. of confirmed cases) from John Hopkinâ€™s university.
Used modules such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. Machine Learning algorithms such as Polynomial linear regression is used in this project for prediction.
